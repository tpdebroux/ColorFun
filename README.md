# ColorFun
Testing out some color theory techniques and color harmony in python. 

Credit goes to EasyRGB.com for the formulas for converting RGB to HSL and vice versa. 
Using HSL to get complement makes it a lot easier as you just need to invert the hue and keep the same saturation and light levels. 

Instructions so far:
Run the color.py file and input RGB color as prompted 
output will be complement color
